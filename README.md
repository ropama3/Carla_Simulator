# Autonomous Car in Carla Simulator

In this script, we will explore how to create the code for autonomous driving of a vehicle in Carla Simulator. The goal is to guide the vehicle along a predefined lane, detect traffic lights and signs, and introduce weather changes within the simulator.

## Part 0

- Install Carla.
- Set up an Anaconda environment to execute scripts related to the simulator.

## Part 1

Run the 'generate_traffic.py' script to ensure proper installation and functionality.

## Part 2

Learn how to instruct the simulator to drive straight (Script No. 7).

## Part 3

Understand how to command the simulator to move "x" meters forward and stop (Script No. 9).

## Part 4

Implement the functionality from Part 3 without stopping (Script No. 10). Additionally, change the weather (Script No. 10a) and apply the code in a different town (Script No. 10b).

## Part 5

Create code to change lanes within the same road using "r" for right and "l" for left (Script No. 11).

## Part 6

Implement a mechanism for the vehicle to stop at red traffic lights and proceed when they turn green (Script No. 12).

## Part 7

Develop code to detect traffic signals and adjust the vehicle's behavior accordingly (Script No. 13). Additionally, create a model for classifying traffic signals (Script No. 13a, open with Colab).

## Final Part

Execute the script 'Autonomous Driving' to implement autonomous driving while detecting traffic lights and signals.
